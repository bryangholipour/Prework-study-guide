# prework-study-guide
a study guide for coding bootcamp students


## Description

In beginning to learn about web development, I've created a study guide that implements the 4 pillar concepts to create content on the internet: 
-HTML
-CSS
-Git
-JavaScript
This study guide showcases all these elements at the same time functioning as a site to input notes about my course. 

Much in the same way a house is built, I used each of these to create a "layer" that either added functionality or aesthetics to the site. as rudimentary as this site is, it will serve as a template for me or another beginning student as to how to build a website.
